<h2>Creating a video</h2>
<p>We have collected a couple of links to help you to make the recording.</p>
<h3>Windows &amp; PowerPoint</h3>
<p>For Windows users with a recent version of PowerPoint we recommend creating the recording using PowerPoint.</p>

<h3>MacOS &amp; Keynote</h3>
<p>For Mac users with Keynote version 10.1 or higher the easiest way is using Keynote.</p>

<h3>Cross platform</h3>
<p>For all other cases we suggest OBS Studio. This is open source software able of capturing screen, video and sound and combining them into a single video file.</p>

<h2>Besides the technical aspects described above, please consider the following</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid wobbling around while recording.</li>
<li>Don’t use any elements that are copyright protected.</li>
<li>Avoid talking too fast. Consider varying your voice, be it in volume, speed or tone. This will help the audience keeping engaged.</li>
<li>Make eye contact (with your camera lens!). Keep the (computer) camera at eye level.</li>
<li>In case you cannot include your talking head on the recording, add a (recent) picture instead.</li>
<li>Design your presentation in such a way that the talking head is not covering (critical) information.</li>
<li>Avoid distracting backgrounds and choose a neutral, as empty as possible background (a white or pale color wall will do). Avoid virtual backgrounds (such as many web conferencing tools have nowadays).</li>
<li>Give preference to natural light but avoid any backlight (e.g. a window or other bright light source behind you). Instead, try a good light in front of you or even on the floor (experiment for optimal results). Beware of (distracting) light reflections. </li>
<li>Choose a silent spot and avoid background noise. Beware of potential echo. The use of earphones with microphone can improve the audio quality of your video.</li>
<li>If possible put somewhere a ‘no noise’ timer (best at eye level) so that you can keep track of recording time.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to give it some practice</li>
<li>… and to smile. It can make wonders!</li>
